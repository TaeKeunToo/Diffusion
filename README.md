DDPM code for fundus photograph generation

We modified the code from https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch to provide a 
hand-on experience to generate fundus photographs using DDPM.

The training with large resolution images (more than 64 x 64 pixels) needs a lot of time. Early stop 
of training will provide some weird images.
